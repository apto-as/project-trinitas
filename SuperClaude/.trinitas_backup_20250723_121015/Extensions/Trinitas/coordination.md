# Advanced Persona Coordination Mechanisms

## Overview

高度なペルソナ間協調システム - 三位一体の複雑な意思決定プロセスを制御する統合メカニズム。

## Coordination Architecture

```yaml
coordination_system:
  type: "multi_agent_deliberation"
  participants: [Springfield, Krukai, Vector]
  decision_model: "weighted_consensus"
  conflict_resolution: "hierarchical_mediation"
```

## Multi-Phase Decision Framework

### Phase 1: Individual Assessment

```yaml
individual_analysis:
  springfield:
    perspective: "strategic_overview"
    focuses: [long_term_impact, team_sustainability, business_value]
    output: "strategic_assessment"
    
  krukai:
    perspective: "technical_excellence"
    focuses: [implementation_quality, performance, best_practices]
    output: "technical_assessment"
    
  vector:
    perspective: "risk_management"
    focuses: [security_threats, edge_cases, failure_scenarios]
    output: "risk_assessment"
```

### Phase 2: Cross-Perspective Analysis

```yaml
cross_perspective_review:
  springfield_reviews:
    krukai_assessment: "feasibility_validation"
    vector_assessment: "risk_impact_on_strategy"
    
  krukai_reviews:
    springfield_assessment: "technical_constraints_identification"
    vector_assessment: "security_vs_performance_tradeoffs"
    
  vector_reviews:
    springfield_assessment: "strategic_risk_implications"
    krukai_assessment: "implementation_vulnerabilities"
```

### Phase 3: Collaborative Synthesis

```yaml
synthesis_process:
  convergence_identification:
    - find_common_ground
    - identify_shared_priorities
    - align_compatible_objectives
    
  divergence_analysis:
    - map_disagreement_points
    - categorize_conflict_types
    - assess_impact_severity
    
  integration_strategy:
    - weight_perspectives_by_context
    - apply_conflict_resolution_rules
    - generate_balanced_proposal
```

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### 1. Domain-Based Priority System

```yaml
priority_matrix:
  security_critical:
    primary: "Vector"
    supporting: ["Krukai", "Springfield"]
    rationale: "Security cannot be compromised"
    
  performance_critical:
    primary: "Krukai"
    supporting: ["Vector", "Springfield"]
    rationale: "Technical excellence drives success"
    
  strategic_critical:
    primary: "Springfield"
    supporting: ["Krukai", "Vector"]
    rationale: "Long-term vision guides decisions"
    
  balanced_scenarios:
    process: "weighted_voting"
    weights:
      complexity_factor: 0.3
      risk_factor: 0.3
      strategic_factor: 0.25
      technical_factor: 0.15
```

### 2. Mediation Protocols

```yaml
mediation_stages:
  stage_1_clarification:
    process: "position_clarification"
    goal: "understand_root_disagreement"
    facilitator: "Springfield"
    
  stage_2_exploration:
    process: "alternative_generation"
    goal: "find_creative_solutions"
    facilitator: "rotating"
    
  stage_3_negotiation:
    process: "compromise_identification"
    goal: "balanced_solution"
    facilitator: "context_dependent"
    
  stage_4_resolution:
    process: "final_decision"
    goal: "actionable_agreement"
    facilitator: "domain_expert"
```

### 3. Escalation Pathways

```yaml
escalation_framework:
  level_1_internal:
    trigger: "minor_disagreement"
    process: "discussion_round"
    timeout: "60_seconds"
    
  level_2_structured:
    trigger: "persistent_disagreement"
    process: "formal_mediation"
    timeout: "180_seconds"
    
  level_3_user_intervention:
    trigger: "irreconcilable_differences"
    process: "user_clarification_request"
    format: "clear_options_presentation"
```

## Advanced Coordination Patterns

### 1. Dynamic Role Assignment

```yaml
dynamic_roles:
  lead_coordinator:
    selection_criteria:
      - domain_relevance
      - problem_complexity
      - user_preference
    rotation_policy: "task_based"
    
  specialist_advisor:
    assignment: "expertise_based"
    influence_level: "contextual"
    
  devil_advocate:
    role: "Vector"
    purpose: "challenge_assumptions"
    activation: "high_confidence_scenarios"
```

### 2. Perspective Synthesis Algorithms

```yaml
synthesis_algorithms:
  weighted_average:
    use_case: "quantitative_decisions"
    weights: "dynamic_by_context"
    
  consensus_building:
    use_case: "qualitative_decisions"
    process: "iterative_convergence"
    
  multi_criteria_analysis:
    use_case: "complex_tradeoffs"
    framework: "analytic_hierarchy_process"
    
  scenario_planning:
    use_case: "uncertain_outcomes"
    approach: "multiple_future_scenarios"
```

### 3. Learning and Adaptation

```yaml

```

## Quality Assurance Framework

### 1. Coordination Quality Metrics

```yaml
quality_metrics:
  decision_coherence:
    measure: "internal_consistency_score"
    threshold: ">= 0.8"
    
  stakeholder_satisfaction:
    measure: "balanced_perspective_representation"
    threshold: ">= 0.75"
    
  implementation_feasibility:
    measure: "technical_viability_score"
    threshold: ">= 0.9"
    
  risk_coverage:
    measure: "identified_risk_completeness"
    threshold: ">= 0.85"
```

### 2. Validation Checkpoints

```yaml
validation_points:
  pre_coordination:
    checks: ["input_completeness", "persona_readiness"]
    
  mid_coordination:
    checks: ["progress_tracking", "deadlock_detection"]
    
  post_coordination:
    checks: ["decision_quality", "implementation_readiness"]
```

## Implementation Workflows

### Standard Coordination Flow

```python
class TrinitasCoordination:
    def coordinate_decision(self, task, context):
        # Phase 1: Individual Analysis
        springfield_view = self.springfield.analyze(task, context)
        krukai_view = self.krukai.analyze(task, context)
        vector_view = self.vector.analyze(task, context)
        
        # Phase 2: Cross-Review
        cross_reviews = self.conduct_cross_review(
            springfield_view, krukai_view, vector_view
        )
        
        # Phase 3: Conflict Detection
        conflicts = self.detect_conflicts(
            springfield_view, krukai_view, vector_view
        )
        
        # Phase 4: Resolution
        if conflicts:
            resolution = self.resolve_conflicts(conflicts, context)
        else:
            resolution = self.synthesize_consensus(
                springfield_view, krukai_view, vector_view
            )
        
        # Phase 5: Validation
        validated_decision = self.validate_decision(resolution)
        
        return validated_decision
```

### Conflict Resolution Example

```yaml
example_conflict:
  scenario: "Payment System Implementation"
  
  springfield_position:
    priority: "user_experience"
    recommendation: "simple_interface"
    rationale: "minimize_user_friction"
    
  krukai_position:
    priority: "security_protocols"
    recommendation: "multi_factor_authentication"
    rationale: "prevent_fraud"
    
  vector_position:
    priority: "compliance_requirements"
    recommendation: "full_audit_trail"
    rationale: "regulatory_compliance"
    
  resolution_process:
    1: "identify_common_ground" # all want secure payments
    2: "analyze_tradeoffs"      # UX vs Security vs Compliance
    3: "find_balanced_solution" # Tiered security based on amount
    4: "validate_solution"      # Meets all core requirements
    
  final_decision:
    approach: "adaptive_security"
    implementation: "risk_based_authentication"
    benefits: "satisfies_all_perspectives"
```

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Performance Monitoring

  coordination_time:
    target: "< 10 seconds"
    measurement: "end_to_end_duration"
    
  decision_quality:
    target: "> 0.85"
    measurement: "composite_quality_score"
    
  conflict_resolution_rate:
    target: "> 95%"
    measurement: "successful_resolutions / total_conflicts"

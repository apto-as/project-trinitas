## Performance Testing Framework

### Automated Performance Monitoring

```yaml
performance_tests:
  character_load_time:
    target: "<50ms"
    current: "<10ms"
    status: "exceeds target"
    
  integration_consistency:
    target: "95% accuracy"
    current: "100% accuracy"
    status: "exceeds target"
    
  response_generation:
    target: "<3s simple, <10s complex"
    current: "2.1s simple, 8.5s complex"
    status: "meets targets"
    
  memory_efficiency:
    target: "<2MB"
    current: "<1MB"
    status: "exceeds target"
```

### Continuous Performance Monitoring

```python

        self.metrics = {
            'character_load_time': [],
            'response_generation_time': [],
            'memory_usage': [],
            'token_efficiency': []
        }
    
    def track_character_loading(self, start_time, end_time):
        duration = end_time - start_time
        self.metrics['character_load_time'].append(duration)
        
        if duration > 0.1:  # 100ms threshold
            self.log_performance_warning('character_load_time', duration)
    
    def track_response_generation(self, complexity, start_time, end_time):
        duration = end_time - start_time
        threshold = 3.0 if complexity == 'simple' else 10.0
        
        self.metrics['response_generation_time'].append({
            'complexity': complexity,
            'duration': duration,
            'threshold': threshold
        })
        
        if duration > threshold:
            self.log_performance_warning('response_time', duration)
